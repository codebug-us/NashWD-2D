# Intro to Javascript
##### In your `script.js` file
* Look at the alert at the bottom of the `script.js` file. Take notice of the variable names. You will be assigning values to the variables used in the `alert`. Once you have all of your variables assigned correctly with the proper names and syntax, you will see this `alert`:

##### In your `script.js` file
* Make a variable for your name. Make sure your variable name matches the name of the variable in the `alert`. 
* Make a variable for your age.
* Make a variable for your favorite color. 
* Make a variable for your favorite hobby.
* Make up 2 more variables.
* Add your 2 variables into the alert command. 
* Open index.html in Chrome.
* You should see a popup that looks like the image above. 


### Not working? Here's a common mistake checklist!
1. Did you follow the correct syntax?
  * EXAMPLE:  `var exampleVariable = "This is an example variable.";`
2. Did you use " " when setting the variable equal to a string (text)?
3. Did you name EVERY variable EXACTLY like these:
  * `myName`
  * `myAge`
  * `myFavoriteColor`
  * `myFavoriteHobby`
3. Did you save and refresh?
